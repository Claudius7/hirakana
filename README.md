My practice app for Android.

This is my repository for my Android app called Hirakana.

Hirakana is a learning/quiz app that can help the users to be able to read/pronounce japanese 
characters and take quizzes that can be personalized to practice what they learned. It also has a 
daily challenge (still ongoing) that will notify users daily to really test the users knowledge
in Japanese.

Japanese characters that can be learned using this app includes Hiragana, Katakana and a little bit
of basic Kanjis however this app prioritizes Hiraganas and Katakanas thus the name of the app.
