# Hirakana 
Repository for my Android app called Hirakana.

Hirakana is a learning/quiz app that can help the users to be able to read/pronounce japanese 
characters and take quizzes to practice what they learned.

Japanese characters that can be learned using this app includes Hiragana, Katakana and a little bit
of basic Kanjis however this app prioritizes Hiraganas and Katakanas thus the name of the app.
